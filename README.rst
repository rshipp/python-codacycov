Setup
-----

Codacy assumes that coverage is previously configured for your project.

To generate the required coverage XML file, calculate coverage for your project as normal, then run

``coverage xml```

Install codacy-coverage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can install the coverage reporter by running:

``pip install codacy-coverage``

Updating Codacy
---------------

To update Codacy, you will need your project API token. You can find the token in Project -> Settings -> Integrations -> Project API.

Then set it in your terminal, replacing %Project_Token% with your own token:

``export CODACY_PROJECT_TOKEN=%Project_Token%``

Next, simply run the Codacy reporter. It will find the current commit and send all details to your project dashboard:

``python-codacy-coverage -r coverage.xml``
